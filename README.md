OVERVIEW OF THE TASK:
TASK:"Customer Churn Prediction System"using advanced ML techniques and data visualization.

OBJECTIVE:The objective of this task is to develop a python based machine learning application that predicts customer churn based on varius features.

DATA WORKFLOW:
1. Data Acquisition & Understanding
    -Load and explore the dataset.
    -Analyze feature distributions, data types, and correlation matrix.
    -Identify missing values and potential data quality issues.
2. Data Preprocessing
     -Handle missing values using imputation techniques (mean/median/mode).
     -Convert categorical features to numerical using OneHotEncoder and LabelEncoder.
     -Apply feature scaling using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.
     -Split data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
3. Model Selection & Training
     -Trained and tuned the following models using GridSearchCV:
         *Logistic Regression
         *Random Forest Classifier
         *Support Vector Machine (SVM)
         *XGBoost Classifier
4.Model Evaluation
      Models evaluated using:
         Accuracy,Precision, Recall, and F1 Score,Confusion Matrix,ROC Curve and AUC Score
5. Data Visualization
       -Correlation heatmap to examine feature relationships.
       -Distribution plots for numerical features.
       -Bar charts comparing churned vs. retained customers.
       -ROC curves for model comparison.
6. Advanced Insights & Recommendations
        -Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain model predictions.
        -Identified the most influential features affecting churn.
        -Provided actionable business recommendations to reduce churn rates

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
    Python 3.x
    Pandas, NumPy
    Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP
    Seaborn, Matplotlib
    Jupyter Notebook

RESULTS:
  -Achieved highest performance with:XG Boost
  -Top features influencing churn: Contract Type, Tenure, Monthly Charges, etc.
  -SHAP visualizations revealed clear patterns in high-risk churn groups.
